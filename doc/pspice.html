<b>NAME</b>
    pspice

<b>FILE</b>
    pspice.so

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
    Python wrappers for NAIF spice toolkit: http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/
    Cobbled together by chris-piker@uiowa.edu.  These are not offical, so
    please DON'T BUG JPL for python wrapper info!
    
    Note:  Unlike the native spice toolkit, NONE of these functions modify
    there input values, instead all results are returned as values.  Tuples
    or arrays are used to return multiple values if need be.

<b>CLASSES</b>
    class error(exceptions.StandardError)
	    Exception type thrown when C-SPICE failed_c() returns true.


<b>FUNCTIONS</b>
    <b><a name="axisar">axisar</a>(...)</b>
        Construct a rotation matrix that rotates vectors by a specified angle about
        a specified axis. 
        
        2 Arguments:
           axis (3-elements) - The (x, y, z) values representing a vector in
              cartesian space.  The axis item may also be anything else that has 3
              indexed components such as a tuple, list, 1-dimensional array,
              single column matrix or single row maxtrix.
        
           angle - The rotaiton angle in radians. Not. that all spice rotation
              angles follow the "right hand rule", so counterclockwise rotations
              about an axis have positive measure."
        
        1 Return:
           rotation - A 3 by 3 numpy array of floating point rotation coefficients.
              Array indicies are row-major.  Thus the first index indicates the
              matrix row, the second is the column, i.e. M[row][column].
    
    <b><a name="bodc2n">bodc2n</a>(...)</b>
        Translate the SPICE integer code of a body into a common name for that body.
        1 Argument:
          int - Integer ID code to be translated into a name.
        1 Return:
          string - A common name for the body
    
    <b><a name="bodn2c">bodn2c</a>(...)</b>
        Translate the name of a body or object to the corresponding SPICE integer
        ID code.
        1 Argument:
          string - Body name to be translated into a SPICE ID code.
        1 Return:
          int - SPICE integer ID code for the named body.
    
    <b><a name="bodvrd">bodvrd</a>(...)</b>
        Return float values from the kernel pool
        2 Manditory arguments:
          string - name or id (as a string) for a body, not case sensitive
          string - short name of a body value, such as 'RADII' not BODY599_RADII'
        1 Optional argument:
          int - size of internal array for kernel values defaults to 26
        1 Return:
          list - a python list of the returned variables
    
    <b><a name="ckgp">ckgp</a>(...)</b>
        Get pointing (attitude) for a specified spacecraft clock time.
        
        4 Arguments:
           id (int) - NAIF ID of instrument, spacecraft, or structure.
        
           sclkdp (float) - The encoded spacecraft clock time for which pointing
              is being requested.  The routines scencd and sce2c respectively
              convert spacecraft clock strings and ephemeris time to encoded
              spacecraft clock.
        
           tol (float) - The time tolerance in ticks, the units of encoded
              spacecraft clock time.  The routine sctiks converts a
              spacecraft clock tolerance duration from its character string
              representation to ticks.
        
           ref (string) - The desired reference frame for the returned pointing.
        
        2 Returns:
           None - If a record was not found to satisfy the request None is
             otherwise a 2-tuple of the following items is returned:
        
           cmat (3X3 tuple) - is a rotation matrix that transforms components of a
              vector  expressed in the frame specified by `ref' to components
              expressed in the frame tied to the instrument, spacecraft, or
              other structure at time `clkout' (see below).
        
              NOTE: cmat is in ROW-MAJOR order, thus cmat[0][2] is the 1st row
              and the 3rd column.  The row index is first, column index is second.
        
              Thus, if a vector v has components x,y,z in the `ref' reference
              frame, then v has components x',y',z' in the instrument fixed frame
              at time `clkout':
        
                    [ x' ]     [          ] [ x ] 
                    | y' |  =  |   cmat   | | y | 
                    [ z' ]     [          ] [ z ] 
        
              If you know x', y', z', use the transpose of the C-matrix to
              determine x, y, z as follows: 
        
                    [ x ]      [          ]T    [ x' ] 
                    | y |  =   |   cmat   |     | y' | 
                    [ z ]      [          ]     [ z' ] 
                               (Transpose of cmat) 
        
           clkout (float) - the encoded spacecraft clock time associated with
               the returned C-matrix. This value may differ from the requested
               time, but never by more than the input tolerance `tol'.
    
    <b><a name="ckgp_T">ckgp_T</a>(...)</b>
        Same as ckgp, except cmat is transposed prior to returning.
    
    <b><a name="clpool">clpool</a>(...)</b>
        Remove all variables from the kernel pool.
        Returns: None
    
    <b><a name="deltet">deltet</a>(...)</b>
        Return the value of Delta ET (ET-UTC) for an input epoch.
        
        2 Arguments:
           float - The epoch at which "delta ET" is to be computed.  'epoch' may
              be either UTC or ephemeris seconds past J2000, as specified by the
              2nd argument.
        
           string - Indicates the type of input epoch, it may be either of the
              following:
              "UTC"  (UTC seconds past J2000 UTC.
              "ET"  Ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB, also known as barycentric
                      dynamical time (TDB).
        
        1 Return:
           float - is the value of:
        
             "delta ET" = ET - UTC
        
           at the input epoch. This is added to UTC to give ET, or subtracted from
           ET to give UTC. The routine is reversible: that is, given the following
           calls,
        
              del1 = deltet(utc, "UTC")
              del2 = deltet(utc+del1, "ET")
        
           the expression
        
              ( del1 == del2 )
        
           is true.
    
    <b><a name="dpr">dpr</a>(...)</b>
        Get the number of degrees per radian.
        No Arguments
        1 Return:
          180.0/pi, where pi is determined by the acos function.  That is,
        
             dpr = 180.0 / acos ( -1.0 )
    
    <b><a name="et2lst">et2lst</a>(...)</b>
        Given an ephemeris epoch, compute the local solar time for an object on
        the surface of a body at a specified longitude.
        
        Brief IO:
           (hour, min, sec, timestr, ampm) = et2lst(et, body, long, longtype)
        
        4 Arguments:
           float - The epoch expressed in TDB seconds past the J2000 epoch at
              which a local time is desired.
        
           int - NAIF body ID code on which local time is to be measured
        
           float - is the longitude (either planetocentric or planetographic)
             in radians of the site on the surface of body for which local time
             should be computed.
        
           string - Form of longitude supplied, either 'PLANETOCENTRIC' or
              ' PLANETOGRAPHIC' (case is insignificant).

           int - The local "hour" of the site specified at the epoch 'et'. Note
              that an "hour" of local time does not have the same duration as an
              hour measured by conventional clocks.  It is simply a representation
              of an angle.
        
           int - The number of "minutes" past the hour of the local time of the
              site at the epoch `et'. Again note that a "local minute" is not the
              same as a minute you would measure with conventional clocks.
        
           int - The number of "seconds" past the minute of the local time of the
              site at the epoch `et'.  Again note that a "local second" is not
              the same as a second you would measure with conventional clocks.
        
           string - The local time on a "24 hour" local clock.
        
           string - The local time on a "12 hour" AM/PM label clock.
        
        NOTE: See the SPICE API docs for details regarding planeographic longitude.

        Clear the KEEPER system:  unload all kernels, clear the kernel pool, and
        re-initialize the system.
        
        This entry point allows you re-initialize the KEEPER system with a single
        call.  The KEEPER system is the kernel management system underlying the set
        of CSPICE APIs:
        
           furnsh
           ktotal
           kdata
           kinfo
           kclear
           unload
        
        This routine unloads all kernels from their kernel-type-specific kernel
        management subsystems (SPKBSR, CKBSR, etc.), clears the kernel pool, clears
        KEEPER's internal file database, and re-sets the watch status for the kernel
        variables used to load kernels via meta-kernels.
        
        No Arguments
        :
        No returns - Operates by side effects, see notes above.

        1 RETURN (float)
        
          The function returns the planetocentric longitude of the sun, often called
          'L_s', for the specified body at the specified time. This is the longitude
          of the body-sun vector in a right-handed frame whose basis vectors are
          defined as follows:
        
            - The positive Z direction is given by the instantaneous angular velocity
              vector of the orbit of the body about the sun. 
        
            - The positive X direction is that of the cross product of the 
              instantaneous north spin axis of the body with the positive Z direction.
        
            - The positive Y direction is Z x X.

        The target and observer define a position vector which points from the
        observer to the target.  The vminus() function may be used to reverse to
        position vector
        
        5 Arguments:
        
           target (string) - the name of a target body.  Optionally, you may supply
              the integer ID code for the object as a string.  For example both "MOON"
              and "301" are legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the target
              body.
        
           et (float) - the ephemeris time, expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB, at
              which the position of the target body relative to the observer is to be
              computed.  'et' refers to time at the observer's location.
        
           frame (string) - the name of the reference frame relative to which the output
              position vector should be expressed. This may be any frame supported by
              the SPICE system, including built-in frames (documented in the Frames
              Required Reading) and frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK).
        
              When 'frame' designates a non-inertial frame, the orientation of the frame
              is evaluated at an epoch dependent on the selected aberration correction.
              See the description of the output position vector 'postarg' for details.
        
           abcorr (string) - indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to the
              position of the target body to account for one-way light time and stellar
              aberration.  See the discussion in the NAIF doucmentation for the
              spkpos_c() function for recommendations on how to choose aberration
              corrections.
        
              Neither special nor general relativistic effects are accounted for in the
              aberration corrections applied by this routine.
        
              Case and blanks are not significant in the string 'abcorr'.
        
              'abcorr' may be any of the following:
        
                 "NONE" - Apply no correction. Return the  geometric position of the
                    target body relative to the observer.
        
              The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the "reception" case in which
              photons depart from the target's location at the light-time corrected
              epoch: (et - lt) and *arrive* at the observer's location at 'et':
        
                 "LT" - Correct for one-way light time (also called "planetary
                   aberration") using a Newtonian formulation. This correction yields
                   the position of the target at the moment it emitted photons arriving
                   at the observer at `et'.
        
                   The light time correction uses an iterative solution of the light
                   time equation (see Particulars for details). The solution invoked by
                   the "LT" option uses one iteration.
        
                "LT+S" - Correct for one-way light time and stellar aberration using a
                   Newtonian formulation. This option modifies the position obtained with
                   the "LT" option to account for the observer's velocity relative to
                   the solar system barycenter. The result is the apparent position of
                   the target---the position as seen by the observer.
        
                "CN" - Converged Newtonian light time correction.  In solving the light
                   time equation, the "CN" correction iterates until the solution
                   converges (three iterations on all supported platforms).
        
                   The "CN" correction typically does not substantially improve accuracy
                   because the errors made by ignoring relativistic effects may be larger
                   than the improvement afforded by obtaining convergence of the light
                   time solution. The "CN" correction computation also requires a
                   significantly greater number of CPU cycles than does the one-
                   iteration light time correction.
        
                "CN+S" - Converged Newtonian light time and stellar aberration
                   corrections.
        
             The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the "transmission" case in which
             photons *depart* from the observer's location at 'et' and arrive at the
             target's location at the light-time corrected epoch (et + lt):
        
                "XLT" - "Transmission" case:  correct for one-way light time using a
                   Newtonian formulation. This correction yields the position of the
                   target at the moment it receives photons emitted from the observer's
                   location at 'et'.
        
                "XLT+S" - "Transmission" case:  correct for one-way light time and
                   stellar aberration using a Newtonian formulation.  This option
                   modifies the position obtained with the "XLT" option to account for
                   the observer's velocity relative to the solar system barycenter. The
                   computed target position indicates the direction that photons emitted
                   from the observer's location must be "aimed" to hit the target.
        
                "XCN" - "Transmission" case:  converged Newtonian light time
                   correction.
        
                "XCN+S" - "Transmission" case: converged Newtonian light time and
                   stellar aberration corrections.
        
           observer (string) - the name of an observing body.  Optionally, you may
              supply the ID code of the object as an integer string. For example, both
              "EARTH" and "399" are legitimate strings to supply to indicate the
              observer is Earth.
        
        2 Returns:
        
           postarg (3-tuple, floats) - a Cartesian 3-vector representing the position of
              the target body relative to the specified observer. 'postarg' is corrected
              for the specified aberrations, and is expressed with respect to the
              reference frame specified by 'frame'.  The three components of 'postarg'
              represent the x-, y- and z-components of the target's position.
        
              Units are always km.
        
              'postarg' points from the observer's location at 'et' to the aberration-
              corrected location of the target. Note that the sense of this position
              vector is independent of the direction of radiation travel implied by the
              aberration correction.
        
              Non-inertial frames are treated as follows: letting 'ltcent' be the one-
              way light time between the observer and the central body associated with
              the frame, the orientation of the frame is evaluated at (et - ltcent),
              (et + ltcent), or 'et' depending on whether the requested aberration
              correction is, respectively, for received radiation, transmitted
              radiation, or is omitted.  'ltcent' is computed using the method indicated
              by 'abcorr'.
        
          lt (float) - the one-way light time between the observer and target in
               seconds.  If the target position is corrected for aberrations, then 'lt'
               is the one-way light time between the observer and the light time
               corrected target location.

          The rules used in the parsing of `str' are spelled out in great detail in

    <b><a name="subpnt">subpnt</a>(...)</b>
        Compute the rectangular coordinates of the sub-observer point on a target
        body at a specified epoch, optionally corrected for light time and stellar
        aberration.
        
        6 Arguments:
        
          1 Method -- is a short string providing parameters defining the computation
              method to be used.  The supported values of 'method' are listed below.
              Please note that the colon is a required delimiter; using a blank will
              not work.
        
                'Near point: ellipsoid'  The sub-observer point computation uses a
                                         triaxial ellipsoid to model the surface of
                                         the target body. The sub-observer point is
                                         defined as the nearest point on the target
                                         relative to the observer.
        
                'Intercept: ellipsoid'   The sub-observer point computation uses a
                                         triaxial ellipsoid to model the surface of
                                         the target body. The sub-observer point is
                                         defined as the target surface intercept of
                                         the line containing the observer and the
                                         target's center.
        
              Neither case nor white space are significant in 'method'. For example,
              the string  ' nearpoint:ELLIPSOID ' is valid.
        
          2 Target -- is the name of the target body. The target body is an 
              ephemeris object (its trajectory is given by SPK data), and is an
              extended object.
        
              The string 'target' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
              blanks in 'target' are not significant. Optionally, you may supply a
              string containing the integer ID code for the object. For example both
              'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate the Moon is the
              target body.
        
              When the target body's surface is represented by a tri-axial ellipsoid,
              this routine assumes that a kernel variable representing the 
              ellipsoid's radii is present in the kernel pool. Normally the kernel
              variable would be defined by loading a PCK file.
        
          3 ET --  is the epoch of participation of the observer, expressed as
              ephemeris seconds past J2000 TDB: 'ET' is the epoch at which the
              observer's state is computed. 
        
              When aberration corrections are not used, 'ET' is also the epoch at
              which the position and orientation of the target body are computed.
        
              When aberration corrections are used, the position and orientation of
              the target body are computed at et-lt or et+lt, where 'lt' is the 
              one-way light time between the sub-observer point and the observer,
              and the sign applied to 'lt' depends on the selected correction. See
              the description of 'abcorr' below for details.
        
          4 fixref -- is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference frame
              associated with the target body. The output sub-observer point 'spoint'
              will be expressed relative to this reference frame. The string 'fixref'
              is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in 'fixref' are
              not significant.
        
          5 abcorr -- indicates the aberration corrections to be applied when 
              computing the target's position and orientation.  For remote sensing
              applications, where the apparent sub-observer point seen by the
              observer is desired, normally either of the corrections:
        
                'LT+S'
                'CN+S'
        
              should be used. These and the other supported options are described
              below. 'abcorr' may be any of the following:
        
                'NONE' Apply no correction. Return the geometric sub-observer point
                       on the target body.
        
              Let 'lt' represent the one-way light time between the observer and the
              sub-observer point (note: NOT between the observer and the target
              body's center).
        
              The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the 'reception' case in which
              photons depart from the sub-observer point's location at the light-time
              corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's location at 'et':
        
                'LT'   Correct for one-way light time (also called 'planetary 
                       aberration') using a Newtonian formulation. This correction
                       yields the location of sub-observer point at the moment it
                       emitted photons arriving at the observer at 'et'.
        
                       The light time correction uses an iterative solution of the
                       light time equation. The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                       uses one iteration.
        
                       Both the target position as seen by the observer, and rotation
                       of the target  body, are corrected for light time.
        
                'LT+S' Correct for one-way light time and stellar aberration using a
                       Newtonian formulation.  This option modifies the sub-observer
                       point obtained with the 'LT' option to account for the
                       observer's velocity relative to the solar system barycenter.
                       These corrections yield the apparent sub-observer point.
        
                'CN'   Converged Newtonian light time correction. In solving the
                       light time equation, the 'CN' correction iterates until the
                       solution converges. Both the position and rotation of the
                       target body are corrected for light time.
        
                'CN+S' Converged Newtonian light time and stellar aberration
                       corrections. This option produces a solution that is at least
                       as accurate at that obtainable with the 'LT+S' option. Whether
                       the 'CN+S' solution is substantially more accurate depends on
                       the geometry of the participating objects and on the accuracy
                       of the input data. In all cases this routine will execute more
                       slowly when a converged solution is computed.
        
              The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the 'transmission' case in
              which photons *depart* from the observer's location at 'et' and arrive
              at the sub-observer point at the light-time corrected epoch et+lt:
        
                'XLT'   'Transmission' case: correct for one-way light time using a
                        Newtonian formulation. This correction yields the sub-
                        observer location at the moment it receives photons emitted
                        from the observer's location at 'et'.
        
                        The light time correction uses an iterative solution of the
                        light time equation. The solution invoked by the 'LT' option
                        uses one iteration.
        
                        Both the target position as seen by the observer, and 
                        rotation of the target body, are corrected for light time.
        
                'XLT+S' 'Transmission' case: correct for one-way light time and
                        stellar aberration using a Newtonian formulation  This option
                        modifies the sub-observer point obtained with the 'XLT'
                        option to account for the observer's velocity relative to the
                        solar system barycenter.
        
                'XCN'   Converged Newtonian light time correction. This is the same
                        as 'XLT' correction but with further iterations to a
                        converged Newtonian light time solution.
        
                'XCN+S' 'Transmission' case: converged Newtonian light time and
                        stellar aberration corrections.
        
            Neither case nor white space are significant in 'abcorr'. For example,
            the string: 'Lt + s' is valid.
        
          6 obsrvr -- is the name of the observing body. The observing body is an
              ephemeris object: it typically is a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface
              point on the earth. 'obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and
              trailing blanks in 'obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you may
              supply a string containing the integer ID code for the object. For
              example both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate the
              Moon is the observer.
        
        3 Return Values
        
          1 spoint -- 3-tuple of the sub-observer point on the target body.
        
              The sub-observer point is defined either as the point on the target
              body that is closest to the observer, or the target surface intercept
              of the line from the observer to the target's center; the input
              argument 'method' selects the definition to be used.
        
              'spoint' is expressed in Cartesian coordinates, relative to the body-
              fixed target frame designated by 'fixref'. The body-fixed target frame
              is evaluated at the sub-observer epoch 'trgepc' (see description below).
        
              When light time correction is used, the duration of light travel between
              'spoint' to the observer is considered to be the one way light time.
        
              When aberration corrections are used, 'spoint' is computed using target
              body position and orientation that have been adjusted for the
              corrections applicable to 'spoint' itself rather than to the target
              body's center. In particular, if the stellar aberration correction
              applicable to 'spoint' is represented by a shift vector 's', then the
              light-time corrected position of the target is shifted by 's' before the
              sub-observer point is computed.
        
              The components of 'spoint' have units of km.
        
          2 trgepc -- is the 'sub-observer point epoch.' 'trgepc' is defined as follows:
        
              letting 'lt' be the one-way light time between the observer and the
              sub-observer point, 'trgepc' is the epoch et-lt, et+lt, or 'et' depending
              on whether the requested aberration correction is, respectively, for
              received radiation, transmitted radiation, or omitted. 'lt' is computed
              using the method indicated by 'abcorr'.
        
              'trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.
        
          3 srfvec -- is a 3-tuple of the vector from the observer's position at 'et'
              to the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric) position of 
              'spoint', where the aberration corrections are specified by 'abcorr'.
              'srfvec' is expressed in the target body-fixed reference frame
              designated by 'fixref', evaluated at 'trgepc'.
        
              The components of 'srfvec' are given in units of km.
        
              One can use the CSPICE function vnorm_c to obtain the distance between
              the observer and 'spoint':
        
                 dist = vnorm( srfvec )
        
              The observer's position 'obspos', relative to the target body's center,
              where the center's position is corrected for aberration effects as
              indicated by 'abcorr', can be computed via the call:
        
              vsub( spoint, srfvec, obspos )
        
              To transform the vector 'srfvec' to a time-dependent reference frame 
              'ref' at 'et', a sequence of two frame transformations is required. For
              example, let 'mfix' and 'mref' be 3x3 matrices respectively describing
              the target body-fixed to J2000 frame transformation at 'trgepc' and the
              J2000 to (time-dependent frame) 'ref' transformation at 'et', and let
              'xform' be the 3x3 matrix representing the composition of 'mref' with
              'mfix'. Then 'srfvec' can be transformed to the result 'refvec' as
              follows:
        
                 pxform( fixref,  'j2000', trgepc, mfix  )
                 pxform( 'j2000', ref,     et,     mref  )
                 mxm   ( mref,    mfix,            xform )
                 mxv   ( xform,   srfvec,          refvec )
        
              The second example in the Examples header section below presents a
              complete program that demonstrates this procedure.
