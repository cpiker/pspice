Prerequisite
============

Pspice provides python bindings for the NAIF c_spice toolkit.  As such the
c_spice libraries must already exist on your system.  These can be obtained
from:

   http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html


Installation
============

1. Set the enviroment variable CSPICE_INC to point to your top level c_spice
   header files directory.  If for example the spice library was installed as
   /usr/local/cspice/  Then CSPICE_INC=/usr/local/cspice/include
   
2. Run installation script.  NOTE: See item (4) if installation fails due to
   missing libary files.  This typically happens on Sun Solaris OS.

  * To install in your home directory under $HOME/lib/python and $HOME/bin:
   
    $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME
      
    and set PYTHONPATH in your .bashrc or .kshrc.

    This will install two files:
       
       $HOME/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/pspice.so
       $HOME/bin/spiceid
	 
	 where X.X represents your python major and minor versions.
 
		 
  * NOTE to multi-os NFS home directory users:
  
    make a directory for each OS sharing your disk space and then install
	 using:
	 
	 $ mkdir $HOME/`uname`
	 $ python setup.py install --home=$HOME/`uname`
	 
	 --or--
	 
	 $ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/`uname`
       

  * To install in the standard sys location:

    $ python setup.py install
   
    The standard system location varies but on unix it's usually
    /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages or /usr/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages
    where X.X is your python major and minor versions.  On windows it is
    usually C:\PythonXX where XX is the python major and minor versions.

    This will install two files, typically at (on unix):

       /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/pspice.so
       /usr/local/bin/spiceid
   

3. If you are maintaining a personal stock of python libraries in your home
   directory, you should set PYTHONPATH in your login shell to point to that
   location, which is typically $HOME/lib/python.  This way all of your
   personal python libs will be found automatically when python is invoked.

	Alternate PYTHONPATHs depending on the install option used above are:
	
	   PYTHONPATH=$HOME/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages
		PYTHONPATH=$HOME/`uname`/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages


4. Sun Solaris operating systems have their library files spread across
   a wider range of directories than a typical Linux distribution.  If 
	installation fails due to an inability to locate needed libraries, then
	break the installation down into separate build and install steps and
	add library location paramenters to the build step.  For example:
	
	$ python setup.py build_ext -L /opt/csw/lib:/opt/sfw/lib \
	    -R /opt/csw/lib:/opt/sfw/lib
	  
	$ python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME
	
	In this example the needed libaries were assumed to be first in 
	/opt/csw/lib and if they were not found there, /opt/sfw/lib is searched.


Testing the Installation
========================

1. To test the spiceid program, just execute the following command line:

   $ spiceid voyager

   The output should be look like:
   
   Type       | Name      | ID 
   -----------+-----------+----
   Spacecraft | VOYAGER 2 | -32
   Spacecraft | VOYAGER 1 | -31
   2 matches

   If spiceid doesn't run, double check that spiceid was installed in either
   the system location (probably /usr/local/bin) or in your directory under
   $HOME/bin.  If the script is present, check it's permission strings to
   make sure it is executable.
   
   Also, make sure the install path for spiceid is listed in the PATH enviroment
   variable.


2. To test the pspice module, print the help documentation by issuing the
   following commands ($ indicates a shell prompt, >>> indicates the python
   interperater prompt):

   $ python
   >>> import pspice
   >>> help(pspice)

   If you don't see the help docs, or you get an import error something 
   is not correct.  Check that pspice.so was installed, in either the system
   site-packages directory, or in your home directory under $HOME/lib/python.
   Also, if you are installing in your home directory, double check that the
   PYTHONPATH enviroment variable is set.
